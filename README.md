This is no longer fully functional due to the Firebase database being disabled.

This was the first larger project I started with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Android Studio.
The original idea was for it to be a broad app that hosted general utilitary funcitons.

This was for my Senior Project and the function I created was a password manager that encryted and stored data in firebase.
The app also had a sign in function using Firebase Authenticator, so passwords would be tied to an account.
